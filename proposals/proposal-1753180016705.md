Motivation
Currently, our protocol lacks a structured way to allocate funds for growth and maintenance. Without a formal treasury system, contributions are ad-hoc and lack transparency.
This proposal introduces a sustainable, transparent, and community-driven funding framework.

A multi-signature wallet controlled by elected DAO members.

Contributions from ecosystem partners

Voting Mechanism:
